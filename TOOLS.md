# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

## OpenClaw Browser Relay

### Known-good port mapping
- **Gateway / Control UI port:** `18789`
- **Chrome Browser Relay extension Options → Port:** `18792`

### Troubleshooting order
1. Check Chrome extension Options port is **18792** (not 18789).
2. Re-save the token in the extension.
3. If auth errors persist, compare:
   - `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`
   - `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist` → `EnvironmentVariables.OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
4. If needed, fully quit Chrome (`⌘Q`) and retry attach.

### Useful token lookup commands
```bash
# openclaw.json token
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os
p=os.path.expanduser("~/.openclaw/openclaw.json")
print(json.load(open(p))["gateway"]["auth"]["token"])
PY

# launchd service token
python3 - <<'PY'
import plistlib, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path.home() / "Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist"
pl = plistlib.loads(p.read_bytes())
print(pl["EnvironmentVariables"]["OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN"])
PY
```

### Symptom notes
- `Gateway token rejected` = token mismatch / wrong token for current relay path.
- Relay settings can look healthy while attach still fails if the port is wrong.
- “Connected/연결됨” after using `18792` is the reliable success signal.

## OpenClaw media / downloads storage

### External media storage root
- OpenClaw media root is moved to the external drive via symlink:
  - `~/.openclaw/media` → `/Volumes/Bitcoin Core Qt/OpenClawMedia/state-media`
  - `~/workspace/media` → `/Volumes/Bitcoin Core Qt/OpenClawMedia/workspace-media`
- Existing media was migrated on `2026-03-10`.

### Preferred download targets
- General downloaded files: `/Volumes/Bitcoin Core Qt/OpenClawMedia/downloads`
- Workspace-related downloads/staging: `/Volumes/Bitcoin Core Qt/OpenClawMedia/workspace-media/downloads`

### Operating rule
- For user-requested downloads (e.g. Google Drive links, direct file URLs), prefer saving explicitly into the external-drive download folders above instead of the internal SSD.
- Inbound channel attachments that route through OpenClaw media storage should now land on the external drive automatically because the media paths are symlinked.
- Keep the external drive mounted before handling large media/files.
