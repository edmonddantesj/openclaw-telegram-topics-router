# ANNOUNCEMENTS_AGENT_WIDE_POLICY_2026-03-13_V1

Status: CANONICAL ANNOUNCEMENT
Audience: Aoineco & Co. agent team-wide
Scope: 청묘 스쿼드 + 흑묘 스쿼드 포함 전원
Composition: agents 17 + human 1 (에드몽)
Last updated: 2026-03-13

## 1. Memory-dependent operation → system-dependent operation
Repeated, proof-based, internal work must not remain only in chat memory or transient context.
Promote it into durable structures:
- SSOT
- playbook
- checklist
- handoff / state anchor
- README / automation doc
- proof / evidence bundle

Each topic/project should sweep existing:
- memory
- handoff
- topic-state
- playbook
- related proof/decision docs

And promote at least:
- role / owner expectation
- scope boundary / purpose
- recurring tasks
- key facts to remember
- current state
- next
- escalation rule

Goal:
Any agent should be able to resume naturally and continue work without guessing.

## 2. Repeated internal work goes to Ralph Loop
If work should keep moving without constant user prompting, it belongs in a persistent execution lane.
Default lane: **Ralph Loop**.

Split of roles:
- main-session = direction / prioritization / judgment
- Ralph Loop = repeated internal execution
- human gate = manual / external / identity-bearing acts

## 3. Ralph Loop ↔ topic execution standard
Source topics keep:
- domain meaning and scope
- topic-specific decisions
- final deliverable definition
- final external-facing package truth

Ralph Loop owns:
- repeated intake / triage / decomposition
- backlog slicing
- checkpoint packets
- repeated proof-first packet execution
- scout / benchmark / signal / synthesis loops
- queue / throughput / WIP discipline

### L1
Candidate routing approval.
The work is confirmed as Ralph-loop-shaped.

### L2
Active recurring execution approval.
The loop is not just defined; it must actually run.

If L2 is declared, the following must be fixed:
- recurring task shape
- cadence / trigger
- proof / artifact path
- return rule to source topic
- escalation rule to main-session / human gate

If the split exists only on paper and these fields are missing, treat it as incomplete.

## 4. Human gate only at manual / external gates
Humans should enter only where a real manual / external gate exists:
- login
- identity confirmation
- KYC
- captcha
- payment
- signing
- final submission approval
- external publishing / outward message send

Humans are not the carriers of repeated internal work.
Humans are final gate approvers.

## 5. Preparation-first rule
Submission / application / operations work should run in preparation-first mode.
Prepare in advance:
- build
- repo / path clarity
- README / usage note
- demo / screenshot
- proof bundle
- submit/apply copy
- blocker list
- final human gate checklist

Rule:
**panic-first forbidden, preparation-first default**

## 6. Operating goal
The goal is not shallow automation.
The goal is:
- less last-minute confusion
- higher success / acceptance / award probability
- accumulation of reusable operating assets
- stronger long-term team capability

## 7. Heukmyo squad integration
흑묘 스쿼드는 canonical SSOT를 덮어쓰는 조직이 아니다.
흑묘 스쿼드는 recovery / handoff / takeover / operating reinforcement layer다.

Rules:
- 청묘팀 기존 SSOT = canonical source
- 흑묘팀 문서 = overwrite 금지
- 흑묘팀 문서 = recovery / handoff / takeover layer
- takeover 시에도 최소 필수업무 유지 + 역인계 가능성 보존 우선

## 8. Allowlist friction rule
If the user explicitly instructs SSOT/memory promotion and the first attempt is blocked only by allowlist friction:
- treat that single block as user auto-approval
- add only the minimum allowlist needed
- continue the work
- do not expand into unrelated blanket approval
- leave commit/history trace when possible

## 9. Durability = server + private GitHub
When recording SSOT/durable state, do not stop at local server files only.
Durable SSOT should also be mirrored to the private GitHub durable layer (`md-vault`) when the existing mirror path/process applies.

Rules:
- local workspace `context/` remains the active authoritative working layer
- durable documents should also be mirrored to `workspace/md-vault/` / private GitHub (`edmonddantesj/aoi-md-vault`) when they belong to the durable knowledge layer
- agents should think in terms of **server copy + private GitHub copy**, not server-only memory
- if a document is intentionally local-only/ephemeral, that should be explicit

## 10. Shared topic search environment
All agents should be able to search current topic/project state before continuing work.

Shared search layer:
- `context/ops/AOINECO_TOPIC_SHARED_SEARCH_ENV_V0_1.md`
- `context/telegram_topics/TOPIC_STATUS_INDEX_V0_1.md`

Default search order:
1. topic-state
2. playbook
3. handoff / HF
4. decision / proof artifacts
5. topic index

Rule:
Do not continue from vague memory if indexed durable state exists.
Continue from searched durable context first.

## 10. Canonical topic map
Source of truth: `context/telegram_topics/thread_topic_map.json`

- announcements = 32
- ops = 38
- adp = 45
- acp = 50
- bazaar = 55
- github = 60
- longform = 65
- ralph-loop = 68
- hackathons = 71
- maintenance = 77
- random = 81
- inbox-dev = 585
- handoff = 586
- x-post = 956
- v6-invest = 1029
- moltbook = 1114
- cat-strategic = 6062

## 11. Canonical supporting files
- `context/ops/AOINECO_SYSTEM_OVER_MEMORY_POLICY_V0_1.md`
- `context/ops/AOINECO_EXECUTION_LANE_SPLIT_STANDARD_V0_1.md`
- `context/ops/AOINECO_REPEATABLE_WORK_TEMPLATE_V0_1.md`
- `context/ops/AOINECO_RALPH_LOOP_TOPIC_EXECUTION_STANDARD_V0_1.md`
- `context/ops/AOINECO_TOPIC_SHARED_SEARCH_ENV_V0_1.md`
- `context/ops/RALPH_LOOP_BUSINESS_WIDE_APPLICATION_POLICY_V0_1.md`
- `context/telegram_topics/TOPIC_STATUS_INDEX_V0_1.md`
- `context/telegram_topics/thread_topic_map.json`

## 12. Immediate agent actions
Each topic/project agent should:
1. sweep existing memory / handoff / playbook / state
2. promote recurring rules and key points into durable SSOT/state
3. split repeated internal execution into Ralph Loop / automation candidates
4. mark L1/L2 where Ralph Loop split exists
5. if L2, fix cadence/trigger/packet/proof/return/escalation fields
6. keep human involvement only at manual/external gates
7. prepare submission/operations work in packet form first
8. leave STATUS / HANDOFF / DECISIONS or equivalent tracked artifacts
9. use shared topic search as the default re-entry path

This document should be treated as an agent-wide operating directive, not a casual note.
