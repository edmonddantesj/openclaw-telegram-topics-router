## Goal
Add 1-line status bubble UI to each agent (mobile-safe).

## Depends on
- `context/adp/ADP_AGENT_STATE_SCHEMA_V0_1.md`

## Spec
- Show `message` near sprite/card.
- One-line only.
- Truncate overflow with ellipsis.

## Acceptance
- Bubble never expands layout vertically beyond 1 line.
- Works on mobile widths.
## Next Actions (decompose)
- [ ] Bubble text source = `message` from `context/adp/ADP_AGENT_STATE_SCHEMA_V0_1.md`
- [ ] Truncation rule (N chars) + line clamp rule (mobile)
- [ ] Error status styling rule (color/priority)
- [ ] Add screenshot proof requirements for Done

## Exit Criteria
- Bubble renders 1-line safely on mobile + screenshot proof attached
