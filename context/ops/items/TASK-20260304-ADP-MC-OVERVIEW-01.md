## Goal
Create an ADP Ops Overview page/panel that shows (at minimum):
- Sessions
- Agents
- Tasks
- Errors
- Health
- Recent logs/activity

## Reference
- `context/adp/MISSION_CONTROL_REFERENCE_ADOPTION_NOTES_V0_1.md`

## Data sources (initial stub)
- `ops/agent_states/agents_summary.json` (or rebuild equivalent)
- sessions list from OpenClaw (if available) or a stub json

## Acceptance
- One screen that gives operator situational awareness in <10s.
- Works even with stub data.
## Next Actions (decompose)
- [ ] Define MVP cards: Sessions / Agents / Tasks / Errors (exact fields)
- [ ] Decide data sources (state files vs live API) and refresh interval
- [ ] Add empty-state + degraded-mode behavior (no data / partial data)
- [ ] Write a minimal mock JSON fixture for UI dev

## Exit Criteria
- SSOT spec section exists + a stub UI can render from fixture
