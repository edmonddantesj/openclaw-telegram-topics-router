"""Moltbook daily scan → detailed draft package.

Goal:
- Produce a near-post-ready daily draft package from publicly available signals
  plus local moltbook handoff instructions.
- NO posting. NO secrets. Safe to run unattended.

Output:
- artifacts/moltbook/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md

Behavior:
- Pull recent Moltbook new posts when available.
- Pull current operator directives from HF / playbook notes.
- Generate a recommended angle, title variants, summary, full draft,
  CTA, end-matter placeholders, and approval checklist.
